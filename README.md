# DEVUTNIA (devootnia)

### Welcome to Devutnia. A Junior Oriented Software Delivery Collective and DAO

This is a lengthy read. It should give you an idea of what Devutnia is about, who is responsible for it and why it was created in the first place. This manifesto is being written with an intention of having a convenient flow that leads you through whats and whys of Devutnia's existence.

It can be read in parts and you should be able to enjoy it too. If the experience isn't enjoyable for you, please open an issue on GitHub and we'll discuss what to do with it (`"It's too long"` doesn't count though). I find playing with words quite amusing, so every feedback helps to hone my skills in this department.

##  1) Origin story

#### Devutnia is no ordinary company
What makes us different? We're here for the juniors, not the other way around.

The word `devutnia` doesn't exist. Part of it was borrowed from a Polish word `drewutnia` (drevootnia) which translates to `lumberyard` or `woodshed` and it means `a place where they shape wood`. Devutnia shapes developers. 

#### Not quite the origin story
Devutnia started as a brand of an IT/Graphic Design [company](https://sasulla.com/) my wife and I own. My wife designs logos and brand books and draws illustrations for books. I work as a CTO in an open-science startup and I am a dev-for-hire. I mentor juniors, I lead IT projects and I dabble in software architecture.

Due to my neuro-atypical nature I am good at spotting patterns. Especially when it comes to human behaviours. I hardly grasp the necessity for human interactions, yet I am really good at finding talents and understanding individual needs. I can also strip problems into binaries and pick most likely outcomes based on previously observed results.

Simply put: if I understand each team member's needs and the company's problems, I can usually draw a high employee-experience-oriented and low business-costs defence plans for the team. Sounds great, but it hardly ever works, because micro-management is a thing.

#### Why am I even here?
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/GpUeJjdxvTIek/giphy.gif)

I am sort of an unwilling leader. I seem to get myself into situations that are about to become inconvenient for me and I manage to fix them before they get the better of me. It worked great when I was in school, but when I went to work and started at the university I realised the world is not my oyster. Manipulating pre-school peers into playing with different toys (so that I could play by myself in a corner) was as easy as supervising a team of my corporate peers (so that we could deliver good results to our superiors), but that was it. I hit one of many glass ceilings in my life - corporate middle management and people's unwillingness to improve things around them. I didn't want to become one of these people in order to achieve something more in my life. I don't have that kind of personality and the personality I have ([INFP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/ce281b61c20ec)) doesn't have what it takes to make it up the corporate ladder.

#### The cake is a lie
Before I became a software developer I had a repetitive job as an accounts payable/accounts receivable agent. Call a client, send an email, add to SAP, add to Excel, add to a website, confirm in SAP, rinse and repeat. I had a lot of other things to do, but the core functionality of my work was as repetitive as it gets (and I worked at a conveyor belt peeling roots off of flower bulbs for 8hrs a day - I never thought something can be more repetitive than that!). After a year of doing the work over and over again I learned the processes, systems and procedures enough to learn some VBA and write a macro that automated core parts of my work. The macro would do a week of my work in 5 to 8 minutes. I would come in on Monday, run the macro and sit on my ass for the rest of the week. I was so bored I started improving things around me. And this is where the real life kicked me on my sitting ass: _people don't like it when things change around them_ (heck, I am neuro-atypical, talk to me about changes to routines). Only two people in my entire team wanted me to improve their workloads. The rest looked at me funny for mentioning it on one of the dailys. Even the upper management wasn't that impressed with my beyond-six-sigma improvement and six-sigma is every corporation's wet dream (or so I have been told). The cake **IS** a lie. 

#### [Is there anybody out there?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLhxKpfCnA)
I didn't have much to do at work, so I started learning HTML/JS. I wanted to write a web service with a UI that would simplify automating processes for my peers. My "slacking off" has been noticed by the upper management and some clients have been taken away from me. I wasn't happy - not only my good work hasn't been properly appreciated, I was actually suffering from it. I wasn't at fault here. My superiors have been informed about the situation: "I have automated all my core processes. My position is obsolete. Give me something else to do".  
It didn't work. I found out that the guy who took over my clients was shitting on me behind my back (the fool CC'd me on an email to a manager of a different branch), so I put in my resignation and went unemployed to learn how to code and start my own company.

At that point in my life I have had enough of people misusing my engagement in their companies and preventing me from achieving my full potential to their advantage. I don't think I could have been more clear to my superiors: "use me, I can improve workloads for your subordinates".

Sadly, there is no personal approach in corporations. They advertise it on their websites and they talk about it on their onboardings, but when push comes to shove, there is no personal approach, because managers are stuck in a rat race. There is a long line of people between what the company wants and what employees get, so how can it ever get personal?

#### I am a big boy now!
The revelation of lack of personal approach freed me from the corporate ladder's chains. Going unemployed ($200 a month - state funded) for 4 months before finding my first internship and then starting an IT company 2 years later was the single best decision in my life. Turns out, all I needed was a bit of creative space coming from me being my own boss and a bit of responsibility for my own decisions. I became a CTO of an open-science startup with only 11 months of experience (now, thinking back on it, it was a huge mistake - **don't ever use juniors to lead your IT project unsupervised!**).

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/iOQXDQUqI0gdq/giphy.gif)

With me being my own boss I could make my own plans, take responsibility for them, learn from my mistakes and... lol, who am I kidding. I was a "CTO" of a startup that was only starting (the first round came 1,5 yrs later), so I had to work for someone else to make ends meet. I was only 11 months into the career so I pretty much knew shit about shit. Aside from holding a position of a CTO without holding the proper knowledge, I had a corporate-IT junior-level full-time job at a company with 20M daily users and nothing really changed in my life. The glass ceiling was still there, but my hobby was my work now. I was actually getting paid good money at my 9-5 for doing what I always wanted to do - sit in front of the screen and solve logical problems all day.

The glass ceiling problem became manageable, because I was not yet good at my new career. I am a self-learner. I can understand why the privilege of "having strong opinions" comes only after one reaches certain experience threshold - if you don't know what you're talking about, your opinion will never matter, because someone will always try to point out your inexperience. As long as your lack of knowledge lets them bully you, you will not be taken seriously.
It took me 4 years of learning to code, neurotically analysing the market, fighting (and loosing to) technological debt, battling my imposter syndrome, battling other devs, and battling my neuro-atypical shortcomings to get me to understand that **my good ideas mean jack shit if I lack knowledge to make them happen**.

#### Life is sweet, but reality can't eat sugar
Maybe I was a little bit harsh towards my corporate-managers during my corporate-finance life? Maybe they wanted to make my ideas happen, but they didn't have the skill at hand? Maybe some things were simply beyond their pay-grade and they had their own glass ceilings?

When I switched careers from finance to programming I had a chance of seeing how projects are built and developed on different kinds of levels of organisations. I built admin panels for corporate analytics, I built MVPs for startups and built mobile applications (when I say "built" I mean I was included in the process from being a CSS copier to being a project leader). And all these things I built were for somebody else. My name is buried beneath NDAs and contracts and almost all of these projects are dead, because people who I built them for couldn't figure it out amongst themselves (so no LinkedIn or GitHub history) or are used internally and I can't even say anything about them. There is nothing to my name after 5 years of career. There are traces of me here and there, but they really say nothing about my skills. 

#### "These aren't the droids you're looking for"
I don't like it. I don't like the fact that all my hard junior commercial work is not there to benefit me in the long term. I don't like that juniors are trained at a conveyor belt and don't get the chance of exploring their own skills. I don't like it that juniors need years of "commercial experience" before even being able to get the job.

Of course this is not always the case and there are awesome companies that support more "IT-aware" approach to software development (all Devutnia's partners), but I have gone through two huge (100+ candidates) recruitment processes as a solo dev and let me tell you this: based on a pool of over 500 dev portfolios and resumes that went through my hands during my career and the patterns they all share show (again, I am not a recruiter) that juniors do not have it easy these days to advance their careers properly. Simply due to the sheer amount of people trying their luck in this industry.

#### Attack of the clones
I know it sounds bad, but after 40 resumes and portfolios I have seen them all. And I am ashamed to admit that my ambition to give proper feedback and code review was in vain. It is impossible to be impartial and honest after going through dozens of todo lists and burger builders. 

Times have changed since my first rodeo. I see juniors started building spotify and twitter clones. Youtubers and coding courses started teaching how to build them and holy shit! I don't think I can do it after 5 years. It's a huge project. One needs to know many things in order to do it properly. I don't think any junior after a coding school can do it. And they can't. I follow a bunch of FB groups for juniors and the proof is in the pudding. Sometimes they can't even debug stuff properly. So why are these things appearing in juniors' resumes? Who is expecting that of them? Why are they being taught this, instead of `this`?

#### How about... a holocratic DAO?
How about we finally do something about IT (pun intended)? About these unrealistic expectations bestowed upon juniors by overly-marketed industry? We have to do something about "1 year of commercial experience" for a junior position. We have to do something about producing juniors who think they can code, because they recreated a big service from a video.

My idea is a holocratic DAO, where juniors have real access to real life projects, where they are mentored by seniors who actually care about juniors' careers and where they don't need to have "commercial experience" to start making a name for themselves in the industry. Devutnia wants to offer juniors a chance of discovering what kind of developers they are and what drives them most in IT.

There is no micro-management in Devutnia. We adhere to holocratic values. Your experience and opinions are important for Devutnia's future and I believe that applying personal approach and understanding each other's personalities makes for a smoother team experience. 

#### "All your base are belong to us"
Devutnia started as a self-funded and bootstrapped project. I have been working 2-3 jobs my entire career (again, atypical nature, I can work 30+hrs straight if I am into it) so I had some extra funds put away to invest. I came up with Devutnia 1.0 (not a DAO yet) in July 2021. I gathered a community of 50 juniors (some are still active) and I applied my own ideas of running a co-shared business.

I tried running Devutnia through my company, but the recent changes in my country's fiscal system have made it very difficult for me to hire juniors per task/hour. There are many juniors who shift careers and they often are unemployed in-between. In my country, it is illegal for me to hire them in the most convenient way for them (a contract - they get most money), because I have to offer an unemployed person a full-time position. If I were to do that, my whole budget would be gone very fast and I wouldn't be able to help as many people as I'd like. I wont to efficiently help juniors on a per task basis. I can't do that when I am worried that I can't afford to pay all the fiscal duties to the gov't BEFORE I can even pay my employees. My inner righteous-self gets super unhappy about it.

Devutnia 1.0 could not function in its original form.

#### What's in it for you and what's in it for Devutnia?
My reasons for starting Devutnia are multilevel. They are opportunistic/altruistic/pragmatic/realistic/meritocratic and capitalistic on top of all that. You are responsible for making a name for yourself here. The senior staff is here to help you discover who you are as a developer and as a self-made person. We will help you realise your ideas if we see you understand the problem you're fixing.

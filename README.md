# Devutnia

To read Devutnia's mainfesto (in Polish) click [here](https://github.com/devutnia/devutnia/blob/main/DEVUTNIA.md).

Welcome to Devutnia's monorepo. <br/>
It is a home of all projects developed by Devutnia's devs.

We are currently working on:

- [Lumby](https://github.com/devutnia/devutnia/tree/main/libs/lumby/README.md) - UI tool for rapid MVP software development

To start working on Devutnia's projects simply clone/fork this repo and install node modules (we're using Yarn).

After that you can run one of these commands to interact with Devutnia's monorepo contents (or check the exsting commands in `package.json`).

```javascript
// it starts up a next.js instance (there's not much going on there ATM)
yarn platform

// this one starts up Lumby's .storybook instance that contains
// documentation for Lumby's components
yarn lumby:docs
```

And that's pretty much it. The project itself is fresh and we're
building up speed :)

We are on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/devutnia/shared_invite/zt-uauopfmu-tEGDHG5e8MimoMirYoErGg) - come say hi ;)

# Cortext

Cortext is a "recent context" management tool aiming to speed up development of POC/MVP JavaScript applications by providing extreme modularity of reactive logic.<br>
Cortext is not another state management library. It is built on one ([valtio]()), but it uses it to ensure your logic works within the most recent context.<br>
State management isn't the goal of this library. Context is.

<br/>

### Testing

Run `nx test cortext` to execute the unit tests.
